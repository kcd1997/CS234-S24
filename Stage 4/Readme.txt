Terminal Ticketing Software Readme:

To compile and run the program, either open the folder as a NetBeans project and run the Main.java class file, or:

1- Make sure you have a java SDK installed, and that you can use the "javac" and "java" commands in the command line.
2- Run the command line program in your operating system.
3- Change your current drive and directory in the command line to the directory which contains the source .java files. On windows, this can be done by typing the drive name, such as "C:", as a command, then using the "cd" command to change to your desired directory.
4- Use the "javac" command on the Main.java file in the chosen directory to compile the needed .class files.
5- In the directory with the .class files, use the "java" command on the Main class to execute the main methods. 

How to run-- Either run the distributed jar file (through the java -jar command or by double clicking the executable), or run the compiled classes from the previous step.
