Assignment for stage 3: I wrote the TerminalData, Menu, MainMenu, and Main Classes, and I worked with the team to create the GetInput and Reader classes for use in our data structure. We all worked on ReportMenu Class functions, and determined some elements of the various submenu classes together. I also did work on standardizing code and commenting for javadocs, and I was in charge of uploading the .java files once the comments were standardized.
